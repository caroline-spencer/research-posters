While I was a part of the Celia Shiau Lab at UNC Chapel Hill, I had multiple opportunities to share and present about my research. In the lab, I studied genetics, immunology, and the function of macrophages using the zebrafish model organism.

In April of 2022, I presented on my undergraduate research project "High cellular resolution _in vivo_ tracing of macrophage activation during tissue injury response" at the Duke University Neuroimmunology and Glia Group's Glia Camp Conference and at the UNC Undergraduate Research Symposium.

In October of 2023, I presented on an expansion of my undergraduate research that I continued as a full-time Research Assistant "High cellular resolution in vivo tracing of acrophage activation due to injury or immune dysregulation" at the international Zebrafish Disease Models Conference in Durham, NC.
